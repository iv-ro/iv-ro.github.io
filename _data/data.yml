career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
     I am a software developer who approaches tasks with an engineering mindset and possesses a solid background in disturbed system analysis and performance testing.
     Additionally, I am passionate about the functional programming paradigm, which is why **Scala serves as my primary programming language**.
     
     **With more than 6 years of experience in Scala development and over 10 years in software engineering**, I bring all the benefits of this expertise to my work. 
     Furthermore, I possess proficiency in Java 8 and Python 3+, which I utilized extensively before transitioning into the world of functional programming, where I can work without the inconvenience of NullPointerExceptions and mutable objects.
     
     I have hands-on experience in designing and analyzing distributed microservice systems. In previous roles, I demonstrated leadership by guiding junior developers, conducting interviews, and conducting comprehensive code reviews. I possess a genuine enthusiasm for learning new design patterns and development approaches. I am always open to feedback and embrace new technical challenges as opportunities for growth.
